      "ng-book. The in-depth, complete, and up-to-date book on Angular. Become an Angular expert today. Updated for Angular, Angular CLI, and Community Style Guide Ready to master Angular? What if you could master the entire framework - with solid foundations - in less time without beating your head against a wall? Imagine how quickly you could work if you knew the best practices and the best tools? Stop wasting your time searching and have everything you need to be productive in one, well-organized place, with complete examples to get your project up without needing to resort to endless hours of research. You will learn what you need to know to work professionally with ng-book: The Complete Book on Angular. Get up and running quickly The first chapter opens with building your first Angular app. Within the first few minutes, you'll know enough to have an app running Lots of Sample Apps and Code When you buy ng-book, you're not buying just a book, but dozens of code examples. Every chapter in the book comes with a complete project that uses the concepts in the chapter. The code is available for download, free from our website. Table of Contents Writing your first Angular web application How Angular Works Built-in Directives Forms in Angular 2 HTTP and APIs Routing Dependency Injection Data Architecture in Angular 2 Data Architecture with Observables and RxJS Data Architecture with Redux Redux and TypeScript Data Architecture with Redux Advanced Components Testing Converting an Angular 1 app to Angular Comprehensive You'll learn core Angular concepts - from how Angular works under the hood, to rich interactive components, from in-depth testing to real-world applications Best Practices Learn Angular best practices, such as: testing, code organization, and how to structure your app for performance. We'll walk through practical, common examples of how to implement complete components of your applications Example Apps included in the book The book comes with sample apps that show you how to create: A component-based Reddit clone A real-time chat app using RxJS Observables A YouTube search-as-you-type app A Spotify search for tracks with playable song preview Plus lots more mini-examples that show you how to write Components, how to use Forms, and how to use APIs The code examples currently have over 5,500+ lines of runnable code (TypeScript, non-comment lines) What our Customers Say \"Fantastic work guys! I have no idea where I'd be with Angular without ng-book. You guys have made this SOOOO much easier to learn and keep up with. Thanks again..you guys are awesome!\" -- Jacob Cheriathundam \"Just finished ng-book2.

An updated version of the code is available for free at our website. Do I have to know Angular 1? Nope! We don't assume that you've used Angular 1. This book teaches Angular from the ground up. Of course, if you've used Angular 1, we'll point out common ideas (because there are many), but ng-book stands on its own Is ng-book an upgrade to ng-book 1? No. This is a completely new book and shares no content or code with ng-book 1. Angular 1 and Angular 2+ are two different frameworks and ng-book 1 and ng-book are two different books.",

          'Develop smaller, lighter web apps that are simple to create and easy to test, extend, and maintain as they grow. This hands-on guide introduces you to AngularJS, the open source JavaScript framework that uses Model–view–controller (MVC) architecture, data binding, client-side templates, and dependency injection to create a much-needed structure for building web apps. Guided by two engineers who worked on AngularJS at Google, you’ll walk through the framework’s key features, and then build a working AngularJS app—from layout to testing, compiling, and debugging. If you have JavaScript experience, you’ll learn how AngularJS helps reduce the complexity of your web app. Dive deep into Angular’s building blocks and learn how they work together Gain maximum flexibility by separating logic, data, and presentation responsibilities with MVC Assemble your full app in the browser, using client-side templates Use AngularJS directives to extend HTML with declarative syntax Communicate with the server and implement simple caching with the $http service Use dependency injection to improve refactoring, testability, and multiple environment design Get code samples for common problems you face in most web apps',

Problems to work on (with solutions) at the end of each chapter reinforce the learnings of each chapter and allow readers to really get hands-on with Angular.',

          'This book offers a concise introduction to the angular momentum, one of the most fundamental quantities in all of quantum mechanics. Beginning with the quantization of angular momentum, spin angular momentum, and the orbital angular momentum, the author goes on to discuss the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for a two-component system. After developing the necessary mathematics, specifically spherical tensors and tensor operators, the author then investigates the 3-j, 6-j, and 9-j symbols. Throughout, the author provides practical applications to atomic, molecular, and nuclear physics. These include partial-wave expansions, the emission and absorption of particles, the proton and electron quadrupole moment, matrix element calculation in practice, and the properties of the symmetrical top molecule.',

          "Build SEO-friendly, high-performance single-page applications with Angular 2 About This Book Get up to date with the latest changes to Angular 2, including the improvements to directives, change detection, dependency injection, router, and more Understand Angular 2's new component-based architecture Start using TypeScript to supercharge your Angular 2 applications Who This Book Is For Do you want to jump in at the deep end of Angular 2? Or perhaps you're interested assessing the changes before moving over? If so, then Switching to Angular 2 is the book for you. To get the most out of the book, you'll need to be familiar with AngularJS 1.x, and have a good understanding of JavaScript. No knowledge of the changes made to Angular 2 is required follow along. What You Will Learn Understand the changes made from Angular 1.x with side-by-side code samples to help demystify the Angular 2 learning curve Start working with Angular 2's new method of implementing directives Use TypeScript to write modern, powerful Angular 2 applications Dig in to the change-detection method, and other architectural changes to make sure you know what's going on under the hood of Angular 2. Get to work with the new router in Angular 2 Use the new features of Angular 2 including pipes, or the updated features such as forms, services, and the DI module Master server-side rendering in Angular 2 to keep your new applications SEO friendly In Detail AngularJS is a JavaScript framework that makes building web applications easier. It is used today in large-scale, high-traffic websites that struggle with under-performance, portability issues, as well as SEO unfriendliness, and complexity at scale. Angular 2 changes that. It is the modern framework you need to build performant and robust web applications. “Switching to Angular 2” is the quickest way to get to grips with Angular 2 and will help you transition in to the brave new world of Angular 2. We'll start with an overview which sets the changes of the framework in context with version 1.x. After that, you will be taken on a TypeScript crash-course so we can take advantage of Angular 2 in its native, statically-typed environment. We'll look at the new change-detection method in detail, how Directives and Components change how you create websites with Angular, the new Angular 2 router, and much more. By the end of the book, you'll be ready to start building quick and efficient Angular 2 applications that take advantage of all the new features on offer. Style and approach Starting with a comparison between Angular versions that is filled with side-by-side code examples to help highlight the changes, each chapter then looks at major changes to the framework as is filled with small examples and sample code to get you started",
