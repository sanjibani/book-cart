Updated for Angular, Angular CLI, and Community Style Guide Ready to master Angular? What if you could master the entire framework - with solid foundations - in less time without beating your head against a wall? Imagine how quickly you could work if you knew the best practices and the best tools? Stop wasting your time searching and have everything you need to be productive in one, well-organized place, with complete examples to get your project up without needing to resort to endless hours of research. You will learn what you need to know to work professionally with ng-book: The Complete Book on Angular. Get up and running quickly The first chapter opens with building your first Angular app. Within the first few minutes, you'll know enough to have an app running Lots of Sample Apps and Code When you buy ng-book, you're not buying just a book, but dozens of code examples. Every chapter in the book comes with a complete project that uses the concepts in the chapter. The code is available for download, free from our website. Table of Contents Writing your first Angular web application How Angular Works Built-in Directives Forms in Angular 2 HTTP and APIs Routing Dependency Injection Data Architecture in Angular 2 Data Architecture with Observables and RxJS Data Architecture with Redux Redux and TypeScript Data Architecture with Redux Advanced Components Testing Converting an Angular 1 app to Angular Comprehensive You'll learn core Angular concepts - from how Angular works under the hood, to rich interactive components, from in-depth testing to real-world applications Best Practices Learn Angular best practices, such as: testing, code organization, and how to structure your app for performance. We'll walk through practical, common examples of how to implement complete components of your applications Example Apps included in the book The book comes with sample apps that show you how to create: A component-based Reddit clone A real-time chat app using RxJS Observables A YouTube search-as-you-type app A Spotify search for tracks with playable song preview Plus lots more mini-examples that show you how to write Components, how to use Forms, and how to use APIs The code examples currently have over 5,500+ lines of runnable code (TypeScript, non-comment lines) What our Customers Say \"Fantastic work guys! I have no idea where I'd be with Angular without ng-book. You guys have made this SOOOO much easier to learn and keep up with. Thanks again..you guys are awesome!\" -- Jacob Cheriathundam \"Just finished ng-book2.

Of course, if you've used Angular 1, we'll point out common ideas (because there are many), but ng-book stands on its own Is ng-book an upgrade to ng-book 1? No. This is a completely new book and shares no content or code with ng-book 1. Angular 1 and Angular 2+ are two different frameworks and ng-book 1 and ng-book are two different books.",

     "description": "Develop smaller, lighter web apps that are simple to create and easy to test, extend, and maintain as they grow. This hands-on guide introduces you to AngularJS, the open source JavaScript framework that uses Model–view–controller (MVC) architecture, data binding, client-side templates, and dependency injection to create a much-needed structure for building web apps. Guided by two engineers who worked on AngularJS at Google, you’ll walk through the framework’s key features, and then build a working AngularJS app—from layout to testing, compiling, and debugging. If you have JavaScript experience, you’ll learn how AngularJS helps reduce the complexity of your web app. Dive deep into Angular’s building blocks and learn how they work together Gain maximum flexibility by separating logic, data, and presentation responsibilities with MVC Assemble your full app in the browser, using client-side templates Use AngularJS directives to extend HTML with declarative syntax Communicate with the server and implement simple caching with the $http service Use dependency injection to improve refactoring, testability, and multiple environment design Get code samples for common problems you face in most web apps",

Beginning with the quantization of angular momentum, spin angular momentum, and the orbital angular momentum, the author goes on to discuss the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for a two-component system. After developing the necessary mathematics, specifically spherical tensors and tensor operators, the author then investigates the 3-j, 6-j, and 9-j symbols. Throughout, the author provides practical applications to atomic, molecular, and nuclear physics. These include partial-wave expansions, the emission and absorption of particles, the proton and electron quadrupole moment, matrix element calculation in practice, and the properties of the symmetrical top molecule.",

It is used today in large-scale, high-traffic websites that struggle with under-performance, portability issues, as well as SEO unfriendliness, and complexity at scale. Angular 2 changes that. It is the modern framework you need to build performant and robust web applications. “Switching to Angular 2” is the quickest way to get to grips with Angular 2 and will help you transition in to the brave new world of Angular 2.

We'll look at the new change-detection method in detail, how Directives and Components change how you create websites with Angular, the new Angular 2 router, and much more. By the end of the book, you'll be ready to start building quick and efficient Angular 2 applications that take advantage of all the new features on offer.
